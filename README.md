# The Iris Unfolded: Multidimensional Data Visualization

## Project Overview
"The Iris Unfolded" is a data visualization project that delves into the 
classic Iris dataset. This project employs a range of visualization 
techniques to explore the relationships, patterns, and distributions 
within the dataset, which includes 150 samples across three species of 
Iris flowers.

## Features
- Visualizations of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal 
width.
- Analysis of relationships between various features of the Iris species.
- Utilization of Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for 
creating plots.

## Visualizations Included
- Scatter Plot
- Pair Plot
- Box Plot
- Violin Plot
- Histogram
- Heatmap of Correlation Matrix
- Swarm Plot

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation
To set up the project environment:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/miliansolberg/Iris-Dataset-Visualization
2. Install the required Python packages: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts included in the project. Each 
script corresponds to a different type of visualization.

## Data Source
The Iris dataset used in this project is a popular dataset in data science 
and machine learning, often used for classification and visualization 
tasks. It can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris
